# Getting and Cleaning Data - course project

The aim of this document is to describe the process of collecting, working with and cleaning the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The data for the project can be found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected: 

1. Codebook.md, which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

2. Run_analysys.R, which include a code to import and clean the data.
3. Readme.md, which describe this repo.
